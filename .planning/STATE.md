# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Every component must either work correctly or be gracefully disabled — no silent failures, no orphaned experiments, no schema ambiguity.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Tech Debt + Shared Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 8 (Tech Debt + Shared Infrastructure)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Roadmap created for v1.1 (5 phases, 19 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0 baseline):**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Total execution time: ~24 min
- Average duration: ~4 min/plan

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| Phase 02 P01-02 | 2 | 15min | 7.5min |
| Phase 03 P01-03 | 3 | 9min | 3min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Key patterns for v1.1:
- B2 + Bunny CDN pull zone (not Bunny Stream) — keep Worker as event bridge only
- surfaceOn as string array (not references) — matches existing essay pattern, no join needed
- Enrichment tooling before data entry — build tools first so data entry is trackable
- aws4fetch (not @aws-sdk) in Cloudflare Worker — AWS SDK broken in Workers since Jan 2025

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 8 (Worker): Audit existing Wistia field names in video schema before finalizing Phase 7 schema plan (gap from research)
- Phase 8 (Worker): May need /gsd:research-phase before planning — HMAC validation specifics and B2 bucket notification rule config are uncharted
